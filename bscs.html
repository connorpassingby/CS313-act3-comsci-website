            <p>
                The everyday impression, or at least in pop culture, paints the programmer as a socially reclusive nerd, hunched over his (and it always has to be a he) computer. The reality couldn’t be more different. In this age of technology, millions of people live their lives, unconsciously reliant on the creations of programmers. Some of their creations are mobile apps that can serve many purposes in day to day life: it’s the map that provides the fastest route to your destination, the wallet that lets you pay your tuition regardless of where you are; it allows you to shop for anything and everything under the sun and communicate with your loved ones even when you’re miles away. These apps and computerized systems are made by programmers to serve a need—a desire to improve day to day life. These are people who might spend all their time in front of their computer but the impact they create has the potential to change the world as we know it.
            </p>

            <p>
                To be proficient in this field is not limited to expertise in software engineering but also knowledge in solving real-world problems. Our Computer Science program teaches skills that are in-demand across various industries such as complex coding, and mobile app and website development. We aim to ensure that our students will be able to acquire competence in skills that can open employment opportunities even before graduation. It is our belief that to study Computer Science is to be able to create and navigate the technology that will build the future.

            <hr>
            <p>
                You will study up to twenty (20) subjects per year. Each subject is equivalent to three (3) units and requires three to five (3 – 5) hours of class time per week. Academic subjects are taught through a lecture set up. Coursework or major subjects have both lectures and practical lab-instruction classes. This is with the exception of 4th year where you will spend all class hours completing a thesis, undergoing career preparation and gaining work experience in an industry related to their degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                *Due to the migration to online learning, CIIT has modified its curriculum from a trimestral academic calendar to conducting classes on a quarterly basis. All classes are taught through online instruction. Each subject is four (4) hours a week with 1.5 hours for lecture and 2.5 hours open for consultation.
